# German Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the DeutschNile learning roadmap! This guide will take you from the basics of German to the A1 level and beyond. Use the checkboxes to track your progress as you advance through each section.

## Fundamentals

Before diving into structured lessons, build a strong foundation with these fundamental concepts:

<ProgressTracker
  items={[
    { id: 'alphabet', text: 'Alphabet' },
    { id: 'aussprache', text: 'Aussprache (Pronunciation)' },
    { id: 'die-syntax', text: 'Die Syntax (Syntax)' },
    { id: 'personalpronomen', text: 'Personalpronomen (Personal Pronouns)' },
    { id: 'die-zahlen', text: 'Die Zahlen (Numbers)' },
  ]}
/>

## A1 Level

### A1.1

<ProgressTracker
  items={[
    { id: 'lesson-1', text: 'Lesson 1' },
    { id: 'lesson-2', text: 'Lesson 2' },
    { id: 'lesson-3', text: 'Lesson 3' },
  ]}
/>
